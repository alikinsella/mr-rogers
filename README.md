# Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood

#### A different take on Fizz Buzz - May 16, 2020

#### By Manny Lopez

## Description

A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

- Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
- Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
- Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

- The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
- The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
- The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
